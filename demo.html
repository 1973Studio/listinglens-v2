    <div class="intel-block">
      <div class="intel-block-header">
        <span class="badge badge--red">Critical</span>
        <h3>Red Flags &amp; Safety Concerns</h3>
      </div>
      <ul class="intel-list">
        <li><span><strong>Takata airbag recall applies to this exact model.</strong> 2014–2016 Jeep Wrangler JK vehicles are subject to a mandatory ACCC recall for the passenger-side airbag inflator. The inflator can rupture and send metal fragments through the airbag. This is a potentially fatal defect. Ask the seller if the recall has been completed — it's free at any Jeep dealer. Check at ismyairbagsafe.com.au with the registration plate.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Registration plate withheld.</strong> The listing says "Check with seller" for the rego plate. This prevents you from running a free PPSR check, NSW rego check, or Takata recall lookup before contacting the seller. Legitimate sellers have no reason to hide the plate — the photo shows it's on the car. Ask for it before inspecting.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Registration expires February 2026.</strong> That's days away. If it lapses before transfer, you'll need a new roadworthy/pink slip inspection in NSW, which could cost $50–$150 and may reveal issues the seller is trying to offload before they surface.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Visible aftermarket modifications.</strong> The vehicle has non-standard black alloy wheels and appears to have an aftermarket suspension lift. Modified vehicles can fail NSW roadworthy inspections, may void insurance if not declared, and modifications must be engineer-certified in NSW if they affect ride height or suspension geometry. Ask: who did the work, is it engineer-certified, and do you have the compliance paperwork?</span></li>

    <div class="intel-block">
      <div class="intel-block-header">
        <span class="badge badge--amber">Hidden Costs</span>
        <h3>What You'll Actually Pay</h3>
      </div>
      <ul class="intel-list">
        <li><span><strong>NSW stamp duty: ~$675.</strong> At $22,500, stamp duty is calculated at $3 per $100 = $675. This is payable at Service NSW when you transfer the registration.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Registration transfer fee: $39.</strong> Must be paid within 14 days of purchase. After 14 days, the fee jumps to $182.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>CTP Green Slip: ~$500–$700/year.</strong> Compulsory third-party insurance transfers automatically but you'll want to confirm the policy and may need to arrange your own.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Comprehensive insurance: ~$1,800–$2,500/year.</strong> Wranglers are in a higher insurance group due to theft rates and off-road use. Aftermarket modifications may increase premiums or require specialist cover.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Fuel costs are significant.</strong> The 3.6L Pentastar V6 is rated at 11.9L/100km combined. At current Sydney fuel prices (~$2.05/L), budget ~$4,900/year for 20,000km of driving. This is not a fuel-efficient vehicle.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Servicing: ~$400–$600 per service.</strong> Jeep recommends servicing every 6 months or 10,000km. At 156,000km, this vehicle is due for major service items including transmission fluid, differential oils, transfer case fluid, and spark plugs if not already done.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>True first-year cost: ~$30,000+.</strong> $22,500 purchase + $675 stamp duty + $39 transfer + ~$600 insurance gap + ~$500 service = minimum $24,314 before you drive it. Budget $28,000–$30,000 including fuel, insurance, and inevitable maintenance on a 10-year-old vehicle with 156,000km.</span></li>

    <!-- BLOCK 3: Known Mechanical Issues -->
    <div class="intel-block">
      <div class="intel-block-header">
        <span class="badge badge--amber">Mechanical</span>
        <h3>Known Issues for This Model</h3>
      </div>
      <ul class="intel-list">
        <li><span><strong>3.6L Pentastar oil cooler/filter housing leak.</strong> This is the most common and expensive issue on JK Wranglers with the 3.6L engine. The plastic oil cooler housing warps, cracks, and leaks — typically between 80,000–130,000km. At 156,000km, this has either already been replaced or is overdue. Repair cost: $900–$1,400 at a mechanic. Ask the seller directly: has the oil cooler housing been replaced? Look for oil residue on the transmission bellhousing.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Pentastar lifter tick.</strong> Another well-documented 3.6L issue. Rocker arms and lifters can develop a ticking noise, often requiring replacement. Budget $800–$1,200 if it develops.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Additional recalls on this model year.</strong> 2015 Wrangler JK has recalls for: clockspring assembly failure (air bag circuit — especially right-hand drive models), seat belt buckle strap separation, and PCM software update for O2 sensor detection. Ask for proof all recalls have been completed.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Warranty is long expired.</strong> The original warranty was 3 years / 100,000km. This vehicle is 11 years old with 156,000km — well beyond both thresholds. Every repair is out of pocket.</span></li>

    <!-- BLOCK 4: Market Context -->
    <div class="intel-block">
      <div class="intel-block-header">
        <span class="badge badge--blue">Market Context</span>
        <h3>Is the Price Fair?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="intel-prose">
        <strong>Comparable listings:</strong> A dealer-sold 2015 Wrangler Unlimited Sport with 117,000km in SA is listed at $28,490. A Victorian dealer has a 2015 Sport manual with 131,000km at $25,990 including roadworthy. This private-sale listing at $22,500 with 156,000km sits below those — but it has significantly more kilometres, is a private sale with no consumer guarantees, and has aftermarket modifications of unknown certification status.<br><br>

        <strong>The "Below Market Price" tag is misleading.</strong> Carsales generates this automatically based on aggregate data. It doesn't account for the higher-than-average kilometres, imminent rego expiry, uncertified modifications, or potential recall status. The price is competitive on paper, but only if the vehicle has no hidden mechanical issues.<br><br>

        <strong>Negotiation leverage:</strong> The rego expiring in days is your strongest card. The seller knows that if it lapses, they need to invest in a roadworthy before they can sell. The withheld registration plate, high kilometres, and lack of service history documentation also give you room. A fair offer after inspection would be $18,000–$20,000 depending on what the mechanic finds.<br><br>

        <strong>New equivalent pricing:</strong> A 2025/2026 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited starts at $82,990+ in Australia. The JK generation (2007–2018) is highly sought after by enthusiasts, which keeps used prices elevated compared to most 10-year-old vehicles.

      <div class="intel-block-header">
        <span class="badge badge--teal">Action</span>
        <h3>Questions to Ask the Seller</h3>
      </div>
      <ul class="intel-list">
        <li><span><strong>What is the registration plate number?</strong> You need this to run a PPSR check ($2), confirm Takata recall status, and verify the NSW rego status before inspecting.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Has the Takata airbag recall been completed?</strong> Non-negotiable safety issue. Ask for the Jeep dealer receipt.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Has the oil cooler/filter housing been replaced?</strong> If yes, ask for the receipt and whether it was the upgraded Dorman aluminium unit or another plastic OEM replacement. If no, budget $900–$1,400 for the repair.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Are the suspension modifications engineer-certified?</strong> In NSW, suspension lifts over 50mm require an engineer's certification. Ask for the certificate and the name of the installer.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Do you have the full service history?</strong> At 156,000km, you want to see evidence of regular servicing — especially transmission fluid, differentials, and transfer case fluid changes.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Why is the registration about to expire?</strong> If the rego expires in days, ask why they haven't renewed. If it's because the car won't pass a roadworthy, that's a significant red flag.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Will you agree to a pre-purchase inspection?</strong> At this age and mileage, a $200–$350 independent inspection is essential. Any seller who refuses is telling you something.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>What's the PPSR status?</strong> A $2 check at ppsr.gov.au confirms no money owing, no stolen report, no write-off history, and no security interest. Do this before paying a deposit.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- VERDICT -->
    <div class="report-verdict">
      ⚠️ Proceed with caution. The price is competitive but the withheld rego plate, imminent registration expiry, uncertified modifications, Takata recall exposure, and 156,000km on a Pentastar 3.6L with known oil cooler issues all require verification before committing. Get the plate number, run PPSR, confirm recall status, and book an independent inspection. Do not pay a deposit before completing these steps. Fair offer after inspection: $18,000–$20,000.
