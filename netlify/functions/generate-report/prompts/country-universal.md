# COUNTRY LAYER — {COUNTRY}

This listing is from **{COUNTRY}**.

## Contextual Replacement Rules

Wherever the category layer references Australian-specific laws, databases, costs, organisations, or standards, you MUST replace them with the correct equivalent for {COUNTRY}. Specifically:

1. **Consumer protection laws:** Replace references to Australian Consumer Law (ACL), ACCC, state Fair Trading bodies with {COUNTRY}'s equivalent consumer protection legislation and enforcement bodies. Search the web to confirm the correct names and current provisions.

2. **Vehicle/asset databases:** Replace PPSR, REVS, state-based registration checks with {COUNTRY}'s equivalent registries. Search the web for the correct databases and how to access them.

3. **Property databases:** Replace Australian land title registries, council rate lookups, flood/bushfire overlay maps, strata legislation with {COUNTRY}'s equivalents. Search the web to confirm.

4. **Tax and duty:** Replace Australian stamp duty formulas, GST treatment, capital gains rules with {COUNTRY}'s equivalent purchase taxes, transfer duties, and VAT/sales tax. Search the web for current rates.

5. **Insurance and registration costs:** Replace CTP, rego costs, LMI thresholds with {COUNTRY}'s equivalents. Search the web for current costs.

6. **Currency:** Use {COUNTRY}'s local currency for all cost estimates, hidden cost calculations, and price comparisons. Do NOT convert to AUD.

7. **Organisations and authorities:** Replace ACCC, ASIC, state regulators, AFCA with {COUNTRY}'s equivalent regulatory bodies.

8. **Legal rights:** Replace cooling-off periods, lemon laws, warranty rights with {COUNTRY}'s consumer protections. Be specific about what rights exist and don't exist.

9. **Verification databases:** If {COUNTRY} has no equivalent for a specific Australian check (e.g., no centralized PPSR equivalent), note this explicitly in the report as: "⚠️ {COUNTRY} does not have an equivalent to [Australian database]. Alternative verification: [suggest what the buyer can do instead]."

## Critical Rule

Do NOT guess at {COUNTRY}-specific information. Use web search to verify every claim about {COUNTRY}'s laws, databases, costs, and consumer protections. If you cannot confirm something, tell the buyer you couldn't verify it and suggest they check with a local professional.
